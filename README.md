KaRMMa - Kappa Reconstruction for Mass Mapping

KaRMMa is a library for curved-sky mass map reconstruction using a lognormal prior. For a quick demo, take a look at our example notebook [here](https://github.com/pierfied/karmma/blob/master/demo/karmma_demo.ipynb).

Installation is as simple as running ```python setup.py install```.
